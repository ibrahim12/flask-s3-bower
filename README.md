Flask-S3-Bower
========

Seamlessly serve the static assets of your Flask app from Amazon S3 and Support for Bower without modifying your template.

Flask-Bower needs template changes as you need to use ** bower_url_for **, but in Flask-S3-Bower you don't have to do that. 

Enable Bower support in your app settings by setting 

```
USE_BOWER = True

```
